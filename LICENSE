This is a working repo by me, Andi McClure <<andi.m.mcclure@gmail.com>>, containing my open source fork of LÖVR. The main difference is that my "lovr-ent" project is bundled in the "game" subdirectory.

The license for lovr-ent (and any source patches to lovr in my github "andi" branch) is:

This license applies to any additions in the "game" subdirectory. Any additions in subdirectories other than "game" are covered by the normal LÖVR license. If the additional lovr-ent license on top of the LÖVR license is somehow onerous to you, contact me and maybe we can work something out.

"lovr-ent" contains several other libraries with their own license requirements. Please see the "lovr-ent" repo for exact license information and documentation.
