## LÖVR config
# y is 'yes' and n is 'no'
# Equal signs should not have spaces around them

## Options
# CC: The "C Compiler" to use.  Some common compilers are clang and gcc.
# STRICT: Fail the build if there are any warnings.
# DEBUG: Include debug symbols in the build, increasing file size.
# OPTIMIZE: Make the executable faster and smaller, but compile slower.
# SANITIZE: Add extra runtime checks to detect memory leaks and undefined behavior (adds overhead).
# CMAKE_DEPS: Assume libraries were built by CMake in the `build` folder.
# EXTRA_CFLAGS: Additional compiler flags (e.g. libraries, warnings).
# EXTRA_LDFLAGS: Additional linker flags.
# PLATFORM: The platform to compile for (win32, macos, linux, android, web, or blank to autodetect).

## Headset backends
# Enabling headset backends adds support for more types of VR SDKs and hardware.
# Some proprietary SDKs cannot be included in LÖVR, so the path to the SDK must be provided.

## OpenGL flavor
# Can be GL, GLES, or WEBGL.  Ideally this should be autodetected though.
